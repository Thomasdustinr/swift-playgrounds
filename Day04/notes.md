Finished the function exercise and learned about Parameters. On the first parameter exercise I got confused and looked at the first line of code in the solution to help get me started. After seeing it, everything else made sense and I was able to complete the second exercise on the first try. I even created some extra functions that were not required in the answer. That concludes the “Get Started with Code” section on Playgrounds. Honestly, the more I try to learn and understand the code I write, the easier everything feels (Shocker, I know). I will definitely need to go back and review some topics but overall I am feeling pretty good about everything and look forward to learning more.
